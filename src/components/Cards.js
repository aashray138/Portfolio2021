            Hello ðŸ‘‹ <br/> <br/>
            <div>
              My name is Aashray and  I am from Nepal ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡µ and currently live in Kalamazoo. I am a senior at
              Western Michigan University majoring in Computer Science. I will be graduating in December 2021. <br/><br/>

              I currently work as a Software Development Intern at SICPA Securink for their Solutions Delivery team.
              I work on the SETS application as a fullstack engineer and help with testing as well. <br/><br/>

              Some of my interests are watching and playing tennis, binging TV shows, researching about new technologies,
              and hanging out with friends. I love travelling and have been to 16 states in the 4 years I have been in the US. <br/><br/>
